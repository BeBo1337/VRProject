# Final Project for Academic VR Course

Ready for submission.

Minor volume warning.

Level 1 is up to 5 kills
Level 2 is up to 15
Level 3 is up to 30 
You win if you get to 30 points (for demonstration purposes so it wont be too long...)
Dying/losing in any level will return automatically to the main menu screen

Shooting should work with any type of input but while testing it only worked with screen taps...
We hope the CardBoardVR has a way of giving input in a similar way...
Looking around will look around ;)

we hope you like it Amit <3
